    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I’m a B.Tech IT student at USICT (2024–2028) with a strong passion for
      coding and technology. I enjoy exploring innovative solutions and diving
      deep into software development. With a solid foundation in programming, I
      continuously work on expanding my skill set to build impactful and
      efficient solutions.<br /><br />
      I have successfully completed the MERN Stack and am currently focusing on
      strengthening my skills through hands-on projects, real-world
      problem-solving, and consistent learning. Alongside this, I’m actively
      improving my Web Development, started exploring nextjs, enhancing my DSA
      skills in Java, and exploring the world of open-source contributions to
      learn, collaborate, and grow with the developer community.<br /><br />
      I’m enthusiastic about connecting with tech professionals to exchange
      ideas, collaborate on exciting projects, and explore opportunities where I
      can apply my knowledge while continuing to grow as a developer.
